## Running from Source

To run from source, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed.

1. Run `cd game`
2. Edit `config.json` to configure ports, if necessary
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Run `npm run start` to start the game
5. Open the game's web page (`http://localhost:3000` by default)

If this program refuses to release port `3000`, it can be terminated by running `npx kill-port 3000`.
If you're using a different port, replace `3000` with that number.
